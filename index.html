      <h5 class="bio-body">Early Life & College</h5>

    <p class="bio-body">I was born in 1990 in New York, but moved to San Francisco, CA in 1993 and grew up there until moving to Seattle, WA in August 2017. Sports have always been a big part of my life. I played baseball since I was 8 years old through my sophomore year of high school. I have been a fan of the Oakland Athletics since attending my first game at age 7. At the beginning of my high school sophomore year, I was still recovering from an injury sustained during a baseball game freshman year, so I decided to join a crew team. I ultimately competed in competitive rowing for three years of high school and was recruited to row at UC Berkeley (Go üêª Bears!), where I majored in American Studies with a minor in City & Regional Planning. </p>
      <h5 class="bio-body">Professional Life</h5>
    <p class="bio-body">After graduating from UC Berkeley in Spring 2014, I joined Enterprise Rent-A-Car in the Fall of that year, where I rose through the ranks of their Management Trainee program and ultimately managed rental operations at three on the US west coast (San Francisco, Oakland, and Sea-Tac International airports) in addition to a few local inner-city branches. Managing daily operations, sales, and customer service at each location helped me develop my sales and service skills, as well as my business acumen. After four years of service at Enterprise, I moved on to work for a home building/land development company in Bellevue, WA in the role of Land Acquistion Specialist. The COVID-19 crisis of early 2020 has created the undesirable current scenario, but has proivded my the perfect opportunity to join the UW Coding Bootcamp with BootCampSpot and pursue a career in software/web development. I look forward to developing my web development skills and create content that I am proud to showcase!</p>
